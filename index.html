				You and I<br>
				We're like fireworks and symphonies exploding in the sky<br>
				With you, I'm alive<br>
				Like all the missing pieces of my heart, they finally collide<br>
				So stop time right here in the moonlight<br>
				Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes<br>
			</div>
			<div class="refrain-element">
				Without you, I feel broke<br>
				Like I'm half of a whole<br>
				Without you, I've got no hand to hold<br>
				Without you, I feel torn<br>
				Like a sail in a storm<br>
				Without you, I'm just a sad song<br>
				I'm just a sad song<br>
			</div>
			<div class="verse-element">
				With you I fall<br>
				It's like I'm leaving all my past in silhouettes up on the wall<br>
				With you I'm a beautiful mess<br>
				It's like we're standing hand in hand with all our fears up on the edge<br>
				So stop time right here in the moonlight<br>
				Cause I don't ever wanna close my eyes<br>

				You're the perfect melody<br>
				The only harmony<br>
				I wanna hear<br>
				You're my favourite part of me<br>
				With you standing next to me<br>
				I've got nothing to fear<br>
